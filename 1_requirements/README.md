     It is actually a two player game. In this game, there isa board with n x n squares. In our game, 
     it is 3 x 3 squares. The tic-tac-toe game is played on a 3x3 grid the game is played by two players, 
     who take turns. The first player marks moves with a circle, the second with a cross. 
     The player who has formed a horizontal, vertical, or diag-onal sequence of three marks wins.

# SWOT ANALYSIS:
### Strength:
      It is an gamming application method ,tic-tac-toe which makes it really interesting to playOwing to the nature of the rules, 
  it is possible for the player to come up with multiple strategies to conquer the game, so It will improve thinking of multiple strategies
